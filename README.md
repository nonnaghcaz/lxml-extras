The lxml-extras package provides additional functionality and QoL features for the lxml library, such as:  

    - Shortcuts for extracting attributes of any (or number of) `<img>` and `<href>` tags with default xpaths  
    - Stringifying node contents while maintaining internal tags (or not)  
    - Scraping `<img>` and `<href>` attributes/links (not tested, needs quite a bit of config to add for `requests`)  

This project is in extremely early stages.
